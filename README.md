# FriendFinder

Friend-Finder is an locally hosted web-based application built using Node and Express. Friend Finder allows users to input their name and a photo of themselves then take a short 10 question personality survey. Once they submit their answers, Friend Finder sorts through their answers and compares them to answers of friends whom are pre-made and stored inside an array. The app then displays a modal with the friend whos answers most closely match the users. It also displays the friends picture.
